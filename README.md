# Muon g-2 Experiment Collaboration
# Precision Muon Group, Univ. of Washington

This GitHub contains the code that I had used to analyze the .ROOT simulation files that are part of the g-2, in order to calibrate the calorimeters currently used in the experiment. It also contains the presentation files that I presented to g-2 leaders that led to the systematic error in the setup in the experiment. Note that the code only follows a specific format, so this is not for universal use.
